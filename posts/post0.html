<p class="blog_body">Hello and welcome to my blog! For some time, I have had
a few ideas for projects that combine my interests in computer science and 
literature. I thought I would post some of them here in case anyone with 
similar interests might find them amusing, provoking, unsound, etc.</p>

<p class="blog_body">The name of the blog comes from a poem by John Donne, in which
the speaker elegizes the recently deceased Elizabeth Drury, who is made a microcosmic 
example of the &ldquo;frailtie
and the decay&rdquo; of a changing early modern world, which is &ldquo;all in pieces, all
coherence gone.&rdquo; In a world where computer science is violating its traditional
disciplinary boundaries, invading the humanities like tech workers do the Mission,
it sometimes feels as if some would like to think this way about the current state of 
the humanities at large.</p>
