<p class="blog_body">I&rsquo;ve been doing some exciting research that I&rsquo;ve wanted to write
about for some time. I&rsquo;ve been working with Professor Blaine Greteman at the
Stanford Humanities Center on the <a target="_newtab" href="https://shakeosphere.lib.uiowa.edu/">
Shakeosphere Project</a>.</p>


<p class="blog_body"><b>Intro to Shakeosphere</b></p>


<p class="blog_body">Shakeosphere investigates the relationships between early
modern authors, printers, publishers, and booksellers. We can think of all of
these individuals as nodes in a network. If two individuals share a
publication, then we can draw a line connecting those individuals. Based on extensive
data from the <a target="_newtab" href="http://estc.bl.uk/F/?func=file&amp;file_name=login-bl-estc">English
Short Title Catalogue</a>, we can construct entire networks containing nearly
all the individuals involved in early English print. These networks in turn provide
a good approximation for the professional, public relationships between these
individuals.</p>


<p class="blog_body">Once we generate these networks, we can perform some
statistical analysis. For example, we can compute the shortest path through
the network between two individuals, including the hubs that connect two
individuals together:</p>


<p class="blog_body"><b>Giant Connected Components</b></p>


<p class="blog_body">We can also compute some statistics on a network as a whole.
One useful statistic is the amount of connectivity in the network. An unconnected
network has very few connections between nodes in the network, indicating that
the individuals are not collaborating very much, or even that they are not
aware of each other. A connected network has many connections between nodes in
the network; intuitively, it is easy to see that ideas and information spread much
more easily through a connected network.</p>


<p class="blog_body">When a network reaches a certain level of connectivity, most
of the nodes in the network become connected to each other and the network
forms something called a Giant Connected Component (GCC). A connected
component is a subset of the nodes in the network where a path exists between
each pair of nodes. Many networks usually transition from a highly unconnected
state to a state with a single GCC consisting of most of the nodes in the network.</p>


<p class="blog_body"><b>The Renaissance and Network Connectivity</b></p>


<p class="blog_body">When we break up the Shakeosphere network by year and look
at the percentage of nodes contained in the GCC, we can see a clear phase
transition from unconnected to connected:</p>


<p class="blog_body">What is exciting is that the explosion of connectivity, roughly
between 1580 and 1620, coincides with what is usually considered the high
Renaissance in England! This is the period when writers like William
Shakespeare, John Donne, Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson, Edmund Spenser, and
many others were producing some of the most famous works in English literature.</p>


<p class="blog_body">According to these results, these writers would also have had
access to an unprecedented level of connectivity among printers, publishers,
and booksellers. Not only would they have been exposed to a much wider amount
of printed texts, but their own printed texts would have circulated throughout
a highly connected and collaborative environment as well.</p>


<p class="blog_body">Conceptions of the Renaissance tend to range from a gradual
transition taking place over centuries to a more explosive phenomenon, taking
place over a few decades, or even a few years. This phase transition in the
English print network, which is only one (important) part of Renaissance culture,
tends to support the latter notion.</p>


<p class="blog_body">Even when taking into account survivability rates for books
during this period, our data seems to suggest that the print network grew in
terms of both the volume of material produced and the connectivity of the
network over a very short period of time. The dramatic growth of print
technology between the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries is not
unlike our own digital revolution, producing a generation of writers and
thinkers different from their predecessors. If anything, this data shows that the
Renaissance is a fascinating time period for future study and research!</p>
