  I&rsquo;ve been recently working on a project with the goal of making textual
  criticism accessible to more people. I&rsquo;m really excited to introuduce 
  <a target="_newtab" href="https://variant.ms">Variant</a>. The purpose of Variant is
  to make it easier for textual critics to do manuscript collation, and to let textual
  critics share this wealth of data with others who are enthusiastic about the study
  of literature.
