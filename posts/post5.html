  I&rsquo;m really excited to be introducing
  <a target="_newtab" href="https://variant.ms">Variant</a>,
  a project I&rsquo;ve recently been working on with the goal of making textual
  criticism accessible to more people. Variant makes it 
  easier for textual critics to do manuscript collation, and to let textual
  critics share this wealth of data with others who are enthusiastic about the study
  of literature.
