<p class="blog_body">I had some extra time today, so I did the same PCA genre
mapping described in my previous post on another group of texts: the books of
the <i>King James Bible</i>. Once again, this method performed remarkably well
on clustering the books of the <i>KJB</i> according to genre.</p>


<p class="blog_body">Here is the genre map:</p>


<p class="blog_body"><img width="100%" src="posts/post2.png"></p>


<p class="blog_body">The words most strongly associated with the first principle
component (PC1) were &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;cut.&rdquo; A brief inspection of the uses of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;
and &ldquo;cut&rdquo; reveal that these words are often used when God is pronouncing
judgment through the Old Testament prophets, e.g., &ldquo;<span class=text>And it
<b>shall</b> come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts,
that I will <b>cut</b> off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no
more be remembered</span>&rdquo; (Jeremiah 13:2).</p>

<p class="blog_body"><span class=text>The second principle component (PC2) is
most strongly associated with the active verbs &ldquo;go&rdquo; and &ldquo;say&rdquo; (it&rsquo;s worth
mentioning that some lemmatization was done on the original data, so words like
&ldquo;going&rdquo; and &ldquo;went&rdquo; would map onto &ldquo;go&rdquo;). These words had higher frequencies in
narrative books.</span></p>

<p class="blog_body"><span class=text>There are a few interesting results worth
mentioning, but not as much as in the Shakespeare map. The book of Revelation
is nearer to books of poetry like the Song of Solomon or the Psalms, rather
than the judgment literature. Genesis is firmly placed within Old Testament
narrative, although some have classified parts of it as closer to books of poetry.
The books of the law (Exodus through Deuteronomy) are grouped together with
books of prophecy, probably because of high frequencies of words like &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p class="blog_body"><span class=text>Still, the ability for PCA on word frequencies
to identify generic structure is clearly demonstrated on a second data set.
And therefore the same questions about genre may apply to the Bible as well.
How useful is it to think of a book of the Bible, like the Psalms or 1
Corinthians, beyond their traditional genres? Is orthodoxy more or less welcome 
when studying the Bible?</span></p>
