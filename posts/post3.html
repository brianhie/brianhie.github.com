<p class="blog_body edit"><b>Edit (2 March 2015):</b> <i>A friend recently directed me
toward <a target="_newtab" href="http://rep.ucpress.edu/content/127/1/1">this article</a>
which asks the literal question, &ldquo;Why is James Joyce&rsquo;s <i>Ulysses</i>
as long as it is?&rdquo; There are also 
<a target="_newtab" href="http://www.representations.org/three-responses-to-ulysses-by-numbers/">
some very interesting responses</a> to this article and how quantitative methods
can be used to address questions in literary criticism.</i></p>

<p class="blog_body">I&rsquo;ve recently been rereading <i>Ulysses</i> by James Joyce
and have been inspired with a computational question. <i>Ulysses</i> is a book
that is often read alongside a lot of supplementary material, whether due to
the novel&rsquo;s difficulty, or perhaps simply because of the enormous amount of supplementary
material claiming to be the authoritative guide to the novel.</p>


<p class="blog_body">Joyce himself seemed to fall into the trap of feeling the
need to provide a guide to his novel. On <a target="_newtab"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linati_schema_for_Ulysses">two</a> <a target="_newtab"
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_schema_for_Ulysses">separate</a> occasions,
he offered neat tables associating each of the eighteen episodes with various characters
or places from Homer&rsquo;s <i>Odyssey</i>, with different colors, with times of the
day, and even with human organs.</p>


<p class="blog_body">Here is an image of the Gilbert Schema, sent from Joyce to
his friend Stuart Gilbert:</p>

<p class="blog_body"><img width="100%" src="posts/post3_gilbert.jpg" /></p>


<p class="blog_body">The question is, then, how well does a computer do at
creating a schema for <i>Ulysses</i>?</p>


<p class="blog_body">If we follow Joyce&rsquo;s model for schematizing, there are some
ideal characteristics we&rsquo;d like to have. The first is understanding <i>Ulysses</i>
at an episode resolution. Ideally, we would be able to reduce each episode to
a single word that not only summarizes the episode in some way, but that also distinguishes
that episode from the other seventeen. There are a number of computational
tools available for detecting important keywords in a text, but for this
problem, I settled on something called the hypergeometric test.</p>


<p class="blog_body"><b>Why hypergeometric?</b></p>


<p class="blog_body">To visualize what a hypergeometric test does, consider a
ball pit with a thousand balls, where only ten balls in the pit are painted
red. Say your friend gives you a sample of twenty balls from the pit. You
look in the sample and find nine red balls. You&rsquo;d suspect, since there were so
few red balls in the pit (only ten in thousand), that your friend has
deliberately preferred the color red when sampling balls. The number of red
balls in your friend&rsquo;s sample seems a lot more than would be expected if you
drew ten balls by chance. A hypergeometric test is a statistical method to
confirm this intuition. Simply put, a hypergeometric test can be used to determine
if a sub-population is overrepresented, or underrepresented, in a given sample
of the entire population.</p>


<p class="blog_body">We can think of <i>Ulysses</i> as a bag of words, where each
episode is a different (nonrandom) sample of those words. Words that are more
important to a given episode will be overrepresented. Using a hypergeometric
test, we can get an overrepresentation score for each word of each episode of <i>Ulysses</i>.
A hypergeometric test works well since we are not only getting important words
for a given episode, but also words that distinguish an episode from the rest
of <i>Ulysses</i>.</p>


<p class="blog_body">Something important to consider is that these hypergeometric
tests are not independent, since overrepresentation of a word in one episode
will necessarily involve underrepresentation in other episodes. Still, we can
take into account the many, non-independent hypergeometric tests we are doing
to determine all the words in each episode that are significantly
overrepresented. And to create our schema, we can simply pick the word that is
the most overrepresented in each episode, according to the hypergeometric test
score.</p>


<p class="blog_body"><b>Introducing the Hie Schema</b></p>


<p class="blog_body">So, how well did the computer do? It seems remarkably well,
making a lot of interesting choices. Below are a few columns from the Gilbert
Schema, with the final column coming from the computer&rsquo;s schema (which I have
taken the opportunity to name after myself):</p>


<p class="blog_body"><img border=0 width="100%"
src="posts/post3_hie_schema.jpg"></p>


<p class="blog_body">All of the words in the Hie Schema are significantly
overrepresented within their corresponding episodes. Many of the words picked
out by the hypergeometric test are also in the Gilbert Schema: &ldquo;tower,&rdquo; &ldquo;kidney,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;editor.&rdquo; There are also some that make a lot of sense, like the word &ldquo;sand&rdquo;
being associated with the famous Proteus episode, where Stephen Daedalus walks
along Sandymount Strand, &ldquo;sandwich&rdquo; being associated with the Lestrygonians
episode, where Leopold Bloom has a gorgonzola cheese sandwich and a glass of
burgundy for lunch, and &ldquo;miss&rdquo; representing the Sirens episode.</p>


<p class="blog_body"><b>A Humanistic Catechism</b></p>


<p class="blog_body">The two most interesting words, though, are those of the
last two episodes. The penultimate episode is the mock catechism, that was supposedly
Joyce&rsquo;s favorite. The most overrepresented word here is &ldquo;human.&rdquo; A quick
search through uses of the word &ldquo;human&rdquo; in this episode reveal that the
catechism&rsquo;s questions and answers are highly preoccupied with corporal and
carnal matters:</p>

<div class="block_quotation">
<p class="quotation">&hellip;the parts of the <b>human</b> anatomy most sensitive to
cold being the nape&hellip;</p>

<p class="quotation">&hellip;he was reluctant to shed <b>human</b> blood even when the
end justified the means&hellip;</p>

<p class="quotation">&hellip;consequent extermination of the <b>human</b> species,
inevitable but impredictable&hellip;</p>

<p class="quotation">&hellip;of the universe of <b>human</b> serum constellated with red
and white bodies&hellip;</p>

<p class="quotation">&hellip;the <b>human</b> organism, normally capable of sustaining
an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons&hellip;</p>

<p class="quotation">&hellip;fells of sewer rodents, <b>human</b> excrement possessing
chemical properties&hellip;</p>

<p class="quotation">&hellip;the 70 years of complete <b>human</b> life at least 2/7ths,
viz., 20 years passed in sleep&hellip;</p>
</div>

<p class="blog_body">And in one particularly dense question:</p>

<div class="block_quotation">
<p>He believed then that <b>human</b> life was infinitely perfectible,
eliminating these conditions?<br></p>
<p>There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from <b>human</b>
law, as integral parts of the <b>human</b> whole: the necessity of destruction
to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate
functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous
menstruation of simian and (particularly) <b>human</b> females extending from
the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and
factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical
operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics:
catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of <b>human</b> mentality:
seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated
regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis from
infancy through maturity to decay.</p>
</div>

<p class="blog_body">In Joyce&rsquo;s catechism, the world is mediated not through the
language of the divine or the unseen, but rather through the physical, the
bodily, and specifically the human. The catechism becomes comic but also
deeply subversive by elevating a normal human, like Leopold Bloom, to the dogmatism
and stylistic seriousness often only reserved for subjects of eternal significance.</p>


<p class="blog_body"><b>Molly Bloom and Valley Girl Stylistics</b></p>


<p class="blog_body">Molly Bloom&rsquo;s monologue at the end of <i>Ulysses</i> is
represented by a different word: &ldquo;like.&rdquo; Once again, looking at the uses of
the word &ldquo;like&rdquo; reveals an important stylistic mechanism specific to Molly&rsquo;s version
of stream of consciousness, as opposed to Stephen&rsquo;s or Leopold&rsquo;s. (Try it
yourself! Go to a digital version of <i>Ulysses</i> like <a target="_newtab"
href="http://www.online-literature.com/james_joyce/ulysses/18/">this one</a>
and CTRL-F for instances of &ldquo;like.&rdquo;)</p>


<p class="blog_body">In Stephen&rsquo;s monologue, for example, the &ldquo;stream&rdquo; of
consciousness is more like a chain of individual thoughts, each separated from
the other by a comma or by a period. Molly&rsquo;s monologue is different; it works
more like an actual stream, consisting of phrases joined together by the word &ldquo;like,&rdquo;
making the association from one thought to another more explicit and smoothing
out the monologue into more or less a single syntactic unit.</p>


<p class="blog_body">These stylistic differences unique to Molly are
representative of the way Joyce genders his characters&rsquo; thought. Stephen and
Leopold think with a throbbing, rhythmic firmness; Molly thinks with a flowing,
windy passivity.</p>


<p class="blog_body"><b>What&rsquo;s the use of schemas?</b></p>


<p class="blog_body">Finally, a few words about schematizing <i>Ulysses</i>. I
tend to agree with the criticisms that such schemas oversimplify the novel to a
few words or set up spurious comparisons to Homer&rsquo;s epic. However, the popularity
of schemas, as well as heavily annotated versions of <i>Ulysses</i>,<i> </i>is
something worth thinking about.</p>


<p class="blog_body">One way of understanding <i>Ulysses</i>, and the 
popularity of schemas, is by looking at the
trends in urbanization during the early twentieth century, during which cities
became larger and immensely more complicated. For example, here is a map of
the growth of London between 1840 and 1929:</p>

<p class="blog_body"><img width="100%" src="posts/post3_london.jpg" /></p>


<p class="blog_body">Urban sprawl happened more or less organically; block after
block could be added, making the city seem almost infinitely expandable. The same
is true for stream of consciousness, especially that of the early Leopold Bloom
chapters. Joyce would add sentence after sentence, growing the size of these
chapters and making them seem more and more complex. Reading the stream of
consciousness in <i>Ulysses</i> would be much like navigating urban sprawl, beginning on the
broad boulevards of external, conscious stimuli before wandering through narrow
alleyways of the internal and the subconscious, before emerging suddenly, once
again, on a wide, open street.</p>


<p class="blog_body">Navigating an increasingly complex city required a street
map, like the one of 1920s Dublin below:</p>

<p class="blog_body"><img width="100%" src="posts/post3_dublin.jpg" /></p>


<p class="blog_body">When representing a complex city, such maps necessarily 
require some amount of simplification. They
include landmarks that help the city dweller orient him or herself. The same
function is fulfilled in <i>Ulysses</i> by the schema or the annotated
guidebook. A first-time reader of <i>Ulysses</i>,
without the aid of a schema, might feel like a newcomer placed in the middle of
New York City, without a map.</p>
