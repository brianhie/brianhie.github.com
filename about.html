<p class="blog_body"><i>Hi!</i> I&rsquo;m Brian, and my diverse set of interests includes the 
study of literature, especially that of early modern England, and the design of 
computer algorithms and systems to investigate interdisciplinary questions.
Feel free to drop me a line at <b>BLHie1 at gmail dot com</b>.</p>

<p class="blog_body"><i>I've lived, studied, and worked in Jakarta, San Diego, 
Stanford, Oxford, Seattle, and now San Francisco.</i> I originally hail from Jakarta, Indonesia,
though I spent most of my earliest years in San Diego, California (it&rsquo;s a nice
place to grow up).  I spent four years as an undergraduate at Stanford
University, where I majored in Computer Science and minored in English
Literature and I&rsquo;m now a software engineer living in San Francisco (as software 
engineers are wont to do).</p>

<p class="blog_body"><i>I enjoy applying my technical skills to problems from a variety of
disciplines.</i>  While at Stanford, I spent four years as a research assistant at <a target="_newtab"
href="http://web.stanford.edu/~hbfraser/">Professor Hunter Fraser&rsquo;s biology lab</a>
where I investigated questions in genetics and epigenetics using a variety of computational
tools. During my time in the Fraser Lab, I co-authored a <a target="_newtab"
href="http://www.cell.com/cell/comments/S0092-8674(16)30339-7">paper in <i>Cell</i></a>
and I wrote an <a target="_newtab" href="http://purl.stanford.edu/zn578yv9941">honors thesis</a>
using machine learning to uncover patterns in transcription factor regulation
of gene expression.</p>

<p class="blog_body"><i>I am also deeply interested in the literature of
early modern Europe</i>, especially England, which began in high school when I
developed a semi-obsessive attachment to the writings of the poet and
preacher, John Donne. I have also sometimes combined my technical expertise
with my literary interests; while at Stanford, I worked on the <a target="_newtab"
href="https://shakeosphere.lib.uiowa.edu/">Shakeosphere Project</a> with Blaine
Greteman, a professor at the University of Iowa and a fellow at the Stanford
Humanities Center, to study networks of early modern authors, printers,
publishers, and booksellers. I also keep a <a href="/blog.html">blog</a>
on which I occasionally post small side projects that combine computing, 
statistics, and literary criticism.</p>
