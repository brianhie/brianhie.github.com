<p class=MsoNormal>Hi!  I’m Brian, I originally hail from Jakarta, Indonesia,
though I spent most of my earliest years in San Diego, California (it’s a nice
place to grow up).  I spent four years as an undergraduate at Stanford
University, where I majored in Computer Science and minored in English
Literature.  I’m now a software engineer living in San Francisco (as many do).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>My interests are broad but there are some unifying themes; I
especially enjoy applying my technical skills to problems from a variety of
disciplines.  While at Stanford, I spent four years as a research assistant at <a
href="http://web.stanford.edu/~hbfraser/">Professor Hunter Fraser’s biology lab</a>
where I investigated questions in genetics and epigenetics using a variety of computational
tools.  During my time in the Fraser Lab, I co-authored <a
href="http://www.cell.com/cell/comments/S0092-8674(16)30339-7">a paper in <i>Cell</i></a>
and I wrote an <a href="http://purl.stanford.edu/zn578yv9941">honors thesis</a>
using machine learning to uncover patterns in transcription factor regulation
of gene expression.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I am also deeply interested in the literature and culture of
early modern Europe, especially England, which began in high school when I
developed an admittedly excessive attachment to the writings of the poet and
preacher, John Donne.  I have also sometimes combined my technical expertise
with my literary interests; while at Stanford, I worked on the <a
href="https://shakeosphere.lib.uiowa.edu/">Shakeosphere Project</a> with Blaine
Greteman, a professor at the University of Iowa and a fellow at the Stanford
Humanities Center, to study networks of early modern authors, printers,
publishers, and booksellers.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I also keep a small blog on which I occasionally post small
side projects that combine computing, statistics, and literary criticism.  The
name of the blog comes from a poem by John Donne, in which the speaker elegizes
the recently deceased Elizabeth Drury, a microcosmic example of the “frailtie
and the decay of this whole World,” by describing how “’Tis all in pieces, all
coherence gone.”  It sometimes seems that the digital humanities would like to
think this way about the current state of the humanities at large.</p>
